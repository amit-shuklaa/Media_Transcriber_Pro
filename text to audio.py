TEXT_TO_SPEAK = "hi everyone and welcome to college and today we're going to discuss some honest advice that is targeted towards aspiring software engineers especially if we want to build a good career intake now this is hopefully one of those videos will encourage us to code consistently if you're already working towards our goals or it might also encourage us to leave coding altogether depends upon our mindset now the first point that i wanted to discuss with you all is regarding competition competition almost hijack software engineering is a very competitive feat which is true nobody is denying that but live in a country like india other population job three societal prestige associated there and jab but people are able to well ji engineers okay ji lawyers okay ji doctors okay ji government exams okay her ache in miss a single field make competition how many other just because we live in india knowledge those three competition k the competition that we see online in my personal opinion it is the bloated form of competition to give real competition your on ground competition were actually come generally when we interact with tier three tier four college students passing general consensus is kat ama our interaction college under around thousand students placements told five hundred to six hundred students are even not serious about placements or placement preparation and it's a major reason had distraction i social media through reasons give ach me everybody knows k software engineering can placement but there are very few students who are actually sitting down and putting in the work to learn those things to learn those skills it is basically like thinking but how those lara college or is time may these purchase books explore ka ka care contact however actually jak to yay situation k under yes there is a lot of competition because a lot of people are setting for jobs a lot of people are applying for jobs the real competition which is about having on ground skills personally distractions but so we actually stand a good chance in securing a good placement or a good internship whatever our current goal is this case happen one more additional advice or if i would suggest you to keep in mind is he always have a good circle of friends around you college calendar jar classmates case but they really have a major impact on what our life is going to turn out like na personally example the college can the kind of friends or the kind of classmates that i had a majority of software engineering field majority discussions he regarding placements internships projects see that he can say i had a lot of friends in college who used to interact in english just jai shi mary communication skills say improve k personally i do not come from a background jab english was the primary medium of communication you have a jab english speaking of awards the motivate kia temporarily as a college is student the kind of friends or the kind of classmates that we have important shire thought us a difficult dose pair but long term may imagine curry the the kind of company that we keep is going to have a long term impact on our career and on our life itself the voyager group of people the regular basis may hangout out career mindful pick mindful choose and second advice is regarding packages student youtube fifty p sixty lp value videos can get live value videos initial inspiration high packages software engineering field coding mindset then it's perfectly majority software engineers initial inspiration were the high packages and that is why d is feel can because this is an ever changing field is can complex problems that you need to solve on daily basis or majority cases made because of the high packages like have her package related on ground reality india herself fifteen graduate job and your average that is still around five point five lp p to six lp would your average package around number majority students their understanding we don't need to associate our self worth with our package package that they become better as a human being self package associate and second advice advice a three movie already life can their excellence wagner success market yes software engineering f candle it actually applies you don't need to run after packages skills per and you know that you're really good at that skill compared to your peers to definitely package and that is what actually happens in software engineer third advice is regarding starting early exceptions majority successful early early majority entrepreneurs successful with their forty age trajectory they only miss a majority in a twenties scan elite thirties scan the camp that is why we see a lot of results in forties or fifties direction campus for example if you are somebody who has decided on campus placements majority companies campus projects maybe have niche development development technology technology just technology based hands could seek oscar rad and you should know that you should have a wow factor in your entire profile it's like having a yellow cat which helps you stand out in the middle of the crowd and which is both important i competitive programming intensive internship the point profile campus campus web development role if you targeting web development off campus may explore devops related to deployment related to american container standardization related to or how many eight level to be able to stand out in on campus or off campus or yates is and work carrying a early startling it placements then there are going to be people there are going to be peers of yours who are ready to put that hard work up next advice for students generally already though in my heavy lag coding but they still feel like that they hate coding up hate just a strong body payment bought intentionally use career programming so we'll become bored at some point artistic ka singing acting point repeated single people tend to become mood and becoming slightly bored is okay it's normal programming feel i hate this work and this is not for me but they'll be almost thick just because feel can their high packages lifestyle to starting packages for example so some of them shift towards non tech positions towards consultant roles starting capabilities outputs benefits we have already put in two to three months of effort major and second programming programming government government long specialization build long term now fifth advice is related to timely analysis of ourselves which last time but when was the last time when was the last time consistently are regularly programming when was the last one month regularly self analysis hard seriously putting social media aspirations social media content is very different from actually to when was the last time actually last time competition but they are not part of the real competition or change ga if we want to be part of that real competition if we want to be part of that specific number of students do actually hard work put in career rules the us social media distractions once again cut off second self analysis job market can placement can apply have analyze position apply placement position apply so is this the resume that you would want to hire for your own startup startup career different perspective second one year immediate senior not two year three years there skills improve wow basically just say similar opportunities scale shortlist and self instead of barber companies can apply and you're not able to get shortlist we're not getting invites for interviews level the self analysis is really really important time to time self analysis ap college eventually so if we want our reality to meet our expectations self analysis important a student by i hope they'll help you in your professional journey i also understand key tech can be a confusing field sometimes there is exactly no true balance placement but you do one thing at a time command web development web development command development command machine learning as a student college eventually or va professional journey can job nicolas help as a student try to do one thing at a time keith that one thing should make a stand in a crowd though han i hope today's session was beneficial for you then keep learning and keep exploring"
